Your world is an ashtray
We burn and coil like cigarettes
The more you cry your ashes turn
to mud
The nature of the leeches,
The virgin's feeling cheated
You've only spent a second of
your life
My world is unaffected,
There is an exit here
I say it is, then it's true,
There is a dream inside a dream,
I'm wide awake the more I sleep
You'll understand when I'm dead
I went to God just to see,
And I was looking at me, yeah
Saw heaven and hell were lies,
When I'm God everyone... dies!
Scar! Can you feel my power?
Shoot! Here! And the world gets
smaller!
Scar! Scar! Can you feel my
power?
One shot and the world gets
smaller!
Let's jump upon the sharp swords
Cut away our smiles
Without the threat of death
There's no reason to live at all
My world is unaffected,
There is an exit here
I say it is, then it's true,
There is a dream inside a dream,
I'm wide awake the more I sleep
You'll understand when I'm dead
I went to God just to see,
And I was looking at me, yeah
Saw heaven and hell were lies,
When I'm God everyone... dies!
Scar! Can you feel my power?
Shoot! Here! And the world gets
smaller!
Scar! Scar! Can you feel my
power?
One shot and the world gets
smaller!
Scar! Scar! Can you feel my
power?
Shoot! Here! And the world gets
smaller!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot,
motherfucker!
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot,
motherfucker!
Each thing I show you is a piece
of my death...
No salvation, ah ah!
No forgiveness, ah ah!
No salvation, ah ah!
No forgiveness, ah ah!
No salvation, ah ah!
No forgiveness, ah ah!
No salvation, ah ah!
No forgiveness, ah ah!
No salvation, ah ah!
No forgiveness, ah ah!
(This is beyond your experience)
No salvation, ah ah!
No forgiveness, ah ah!
(Repeats)
For-give-ness!
(Repeat x8)
I went to God just to see,
And I was looking at me, yeah
Saw heaven and hell were lies,
When I'm God everyone... dies!
Scar! Can you feel my power?
